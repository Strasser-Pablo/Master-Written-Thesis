\chapter*{Abstract}

\mtcaddchapter[Abstract]

We will in this work present how to solve Navier-Stokes equations with a marker and cell method.
We use direct Navier-Stokes approach without other model than the Navier-Stokes equations.
We emphasy the mathematical modularity which allow to work separatly on every piece of this work.
Our method work for every Runge-Kutta method (explicit or implicit), if we note $k$ the order of the choosen Runge-Kutta method,
our method is of order $k$ if we ignore boundary conditions, of order $k$ at the better case and of order $1$ for specific complicated case.
Our method is exactly divergence free (at numerical precision).

We will specially be interested in free surface boundary condition. The final goal is to solve a Jet d'Eau.
This goal was only partialy attained, but the needed basics are there.

\chapter*{Introduction}

\mtcaddchapter[Introduction]

This work consists of the following chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A notation and basic math property chapter.
 \item A chapter that describe the problem analyticaly. In this chapter no discretization is done, but equation are written in the good form to motivate discretization.
 \item A chapter that is interested on the solution of Navier-Stokes equation if the domain of computation is fixed.
 \item A chapter that indicate the change needed to allow domain change.
 \item To end, a conclusion chapter which will contain pist to upgrade the scheme used.
\end{enumerate}

The two numerical chapters contain pseudo code that implement the described algorithm.
