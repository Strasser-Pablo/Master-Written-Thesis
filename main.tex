We will in this work present how to solve Navier-Stokes equations with a marker and cell method.
We emphasy the mathematical modularity witch allow to work separatly on every piece of this work.
Our method work for every Runge-Kutta method (explicit or implicit), if we note $k$ the order of the choosen Runge-Kutta method,
our method is of order $k$ if we ignore boundaries conditions, of order $k$ at the better case and of order $1$ for specific complicated case.
Our method is exactly divergence free (at numerical precision).
