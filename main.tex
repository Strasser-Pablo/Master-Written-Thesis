\chapter*{Abstract}

\mtcaddchapter[Abstract]

We will in this work present how to solve Navier-Stokes equations with a marker and cell method.
We use direct Navier-Stokes approach without other model than the Navier-Stokes equations.
We emphasy the mathematical modularity which allow to work separatly on every piece of this work.
Our method work for every Runge-Kutta method (explicit or implicit), if we note $k$ the order of the choosen Runge-Kutta method,
our method is of order $k$ if we ignore boundary conditions, of order $k$ at the better case and of order $1$ for specific complicated case.
Our method is exactly divergence free (at numerical precision).

We will specially be interested in free surface boundary conditions. The final goal is to solve a Jet d'Eau.
This goal was only partially achieved, but the needed basics are there.

\chapter*{Introduction}

\mtcaddchapter[Introduction]

This work consists of the following chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A notation and basic math property chapter.
 \item A chapter that describe the problem analytically. In this chapter no discretization is done, but equations are written in the good form to motivate discretization.
 \item A chapter that is interested on the solution of Navier-Stokes equations if the domain of computation is fixed.
 \item A chapter that indicate the change needed to allow domain change.
 \item To end, a conclusion chapter which will contain pist to upgrade the scheme used.
\end{enumerate}

The two numerical chapters contain pseudo code that implement the described algorithm.

The original \textbf{C++11} code can be found on \url{https://github.com/Strasser-Pablo/Mac}
but is not needed to understand this work, the pseudo code is sufficient.

All the chapters are self contained,
but further information and inspiration come from:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Algorithmic idea like the layer variable and the first scheme come from \cite{fluidforrestofus}.
 \item Analytical comprehension and better formulation come from \cite{citeulike:11163809}.
 \item Extrapolation for boundary conditions come from \cite{FLD:FLD148}.
 \item Analytical solution are taken from \cite{Batchelor} and \cite{Kampanis:2006:SGH:1148052.1148065}.
 \item A review of marker and cell based method can be found in \cite{citeulike:3055787}.
\end{itemize}
